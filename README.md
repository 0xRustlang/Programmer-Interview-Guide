# Programmer-Interview-Guide

This is a guide who helps programmer find their ideal job!

Currently, I am working hard on finding a awesome front end job.

There are a lot of resource on the Internet. However, with developer spirit, I would like to integrate these articles and work and so on.

I believe this will not only improve my interview skill, coding skill, I will also help a lot of new programmer.

**Temporarily, this article will mainly focus on front end.**

## Todo list

* Collecting classical questions as much as I can, including interview questions and technique questions.
* Try to find out the answer.

## What you can do for this

* If you are new in this field, you can talk about the most diffcult part for you corrently.
* If you are rather experienced in programming, please let me know how to improve this and help many other people!
* Give me some idea about how I structure this project, like how to classify the folders or how to display data and so on!

Please submit your question via issue!
